# Blood_Test_Analysis
Since the determination in routine blood tests allows the detection of alterations that in certain circumstances could progress to defined pathologies with serious cardiovascular repercussions in this population group, the frequency in older adults of various subclinical pathologies and the association between the factors cardiovascular risk and such subclinical pathologies. From the subject Introduction to Data Mining, it is requested: a. Describe the univariate distribution of the variables present in the data set. Are outliers evident in any of them? b. Calculate and interpret the correlation matrix. c. Perform a principal component analysis. What percentage of the total variability can explain the first two components? Is it possible to perform an interpretation on the components? Which? Are these components able to differentiate patients according to sex? d. Are there different subgroups of patients in the data? How many can you identify? What characteristics do they have? Explain the methodology used. and. Construct the dichotomous variable 'obesity' (body mass index greater than 30) and construct a predictive model using only the sex of the patient and the variables of the results of the laboratory tests (hematocrit, glycemia, Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides ). What predictive capacity does this model have?
